    "The issues that we are addressing with this project include ones that incorporate the inconsistencies of rhetoric of influential people when attempting to gain positions of power. We are analyzing how different politicians talk when they are on campaign and when they are not on campaign. We currently have the tweets of Donald Trump and are investigating the frequency of certain words and are determining the rhetoric that is displayed by it. "

For instance, we currently have the tweets of Trump, but we plan to incorporate the tweets of Kamala Harris, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. "
